# Secure Rails

Everyone writing code must be responsible for security. :lock:

Start with the [Rails Security Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html) to see how Rails protects you.

Also, check out [this guide](https://ankane.org/sensitive-data-rails) for securing sensitive data.

## Best Practices

- Keep secret tokens out of your code - `ENV` variables are a good practice

- Even with ActiveRecord, SQL injection is still possible if misused

  ```ruby
  User.group(params[:column])
  ```

  is vulnerable to injection. [Learn about other methods](https://rails-sqli.org)

- Use [SecureHeaders](https://github.com/twitter/secureheaders)

- Protect all data in transit with HTTPS - you can get free SSL certificates from [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

  Add the following to `config/environments/production.rb`

  ```ruby
  config.force_ssl = true
  ```

- Add your domain to the [HSTS Preload List](https://hstspreload.org/)

  ```ruby
  config.ssl_options = {hsts: {subdomains: true, preload: true, expires: 1.year}}
  ```

- Protect sensitive database fields with a library like [attr_encrypted](https://github.com/attr-encrypted/attr_encrypted) and possibly [KMS Encrypted](https://github.com/ankane/kms_encrypted)

- Protect sensitive files with a library like [Lockbox](https://github.com/ankane/lockbox)

- Prevent [host header injection](http://carlos.bueno.org/2008/06/host-header-injection.html) - add the following to `config/environments/production.rb`

  ```ruby
  config.action_controller.default_url_options = {host: "www.yoursite.com"}
  config.action_controller.asset_host = "www.yoursite.com"
  ```

- Set `autocomplete="off"` for sensitive form fields, like credit card number

- Make sure sensitive request parameters aren’t logged

  ```ruby
  Rails.application.config.filter_parameters += [:credit_card_number]
  ```

- Use a trusted library like [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for authentication (see [Hardening Devise](https://ankane.org/hardening-devise) if applicable)

- Notify users of password changes

- Notify users of email address changes - send an email to both the old and new address

- Rate limit login attempts with [Rack Attack](https://github.com/kickstarter/rack-attack)

- Log all successful and failed login attempts and password reset attempts (check out [Authtrail](https://github.com/ankane/authtrail) if you use Devise)

- Rails has a number of gems for [authorization](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/rails_authorization) - we like [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit)

- Ask search engines not to index pages with secret tokens in the URL

  ```html
  <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
  ```

- Ask the browser [not to cache pages](https://stackoverflow.com/a/748646) with sensitive information

  ```ruby
  response.headers["Cache-Control"] = "no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate"
  response.headers["Pragma"] = "no-cache"
  response.headers["Expires"] = "Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT"
  ```

- Use `json_escape` when passing variables to JavaScript, or better yet, a library like [Gon](https://github.com/gazay/gon)

  ```erb
  <script>
    var currentUser = <%= raw json_escape(current_user.to_json) %>;
  </script>
  ```

- [Be careful](https://product.reverb.com/2015/08/29/stay-safe-while-using-html_safe-in-rails/) with `html_safe`

- Don’t use assets from a public CDN, as this creates unnecessary availability and security risk

  Use `integrity: true, crossorigin: "anonymous"` on `javascript_include_tag` and `stylesheet_link_tag` for assets behind CDN ([Sprockets 3.x supports this](https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails/blob/bbfcefda3240d924260e3530f896be94cdf23034/README.md#sri-support), and see [Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) & [Crossorigin attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_settings_attributes))

## Open Source Tools

- [Brakeman](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman) is a great static analysis tool - it scans your code for vulnerabilities
- [bundler-audit](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit) checks for vulnerable versions of gems

  ```sh
  gem install bundler-audit
  bundle audit check --update
  ```

  To fix `Insecure Source URI` issues with the `github` option, add to the top of your `Gemfile`:

  ```ruby
  git_source(:github) do |repo_name|
    repo_name = "#{repo_name}/#{repo_name}" unless repo_name.include?("/")
    "https://github.com/#{repo_name}.git"
  end
  ```

  And run `bundle install`.

- [npm audit](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/running-a-security-audit) checks for vulnerable versions of JavaScript packages (if you use `package.json`)
- [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) prevents you from committing sensitive info

  ```ruby
  brew install git-secrets
  git secrets --register-aws --global
  git secrets --install
  git secrets --scan
  ```
